# MASS-Shelter
Java OOP project that was created during CSE1325, deserves a standalone repository.

##Includes
- The ability to add/remove 3 choices of species to the shelter.
> Guinea Pigs, Parrots, and Lizards

- Adopters' contact information for later use
- Customized file type and the ability to save/load one shelter.

## Notes
- Nothing too exciting, basic Java UI programming and OOP construction. Expect basic things.
